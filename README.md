- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Ausrif-Dev
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in robotic automation processes, process automation, machine learning and some programming.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the industry robotic automation system software, machine learning domains and some tech stacks in software development.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have the knowledge of programming language such as Python, Java, C, C++, Assembly and the list continues (Technically I like to read and understand any code structure).
